## Integration mappings for Slack

  Learn how the Box Enterprise Admin (EA) can customize the upload folder of the Slack channel to any folder
within the enterprise instead of relying on the default one with the [Integration Mappings for Slack][2023-06-26_1] guide.

Use Box API to [create][2023-06-26_2], [list][2023-06-26_3], [update][2023-06-26_4], and [delete][2023-06-26_5] the Slack Integration Mappings. 

Using the [automation script][2023-06-26_9], an admin can create or update multiple mappings at once!

Check the [Troubleshooting][2023-06-26_6] section to find out solutions to most common issues you can encounter.
