## Add more details to Custom Apps

  To clarify [Custom Apps][2023-04-17_1]' purpose and add the value for the enterprise, we now offer a possibility of describing the Custom App in a more granular way.

When setting up a Custom App with [OAuth][2023-04-17_2], [JWT][2023-04-17_3] or [Client Credentials][2023-04-17_4], you can now specify the purpose of the app and the app's creator.
Additionally, if you intend to integrate your app with an external system, you can define the integration category and provide details of the external system.
