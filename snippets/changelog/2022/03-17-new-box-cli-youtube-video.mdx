## New Box CLI YouTube Video

  Back in February, we [launched][2022-03-17_3] the OAuth 2.0 version of the Box CLI, alongside
new YouTube content. Today, we released [video 2][2022-03-17_4] of the series. It shows
using the built in help functionality to create a folder with the CLI.

You can find the Box Platform and Developer Playlist on [YouTube][2022-03-17_2]. We have two
more videos planned: Advanced Topics (including as-user) and CLI Automation
using PowerShell.
