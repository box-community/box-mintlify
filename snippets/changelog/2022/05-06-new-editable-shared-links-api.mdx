## New Editable Shared Links API

  Now, developers can make files editable via shared links using the API. 

{/* more */}

## Documentation Updates
* Added a new `can_edit` value to the `permissions` object for the [file][2021-05-06_3], [folder][2021-05-06_2], and [web link][2021-05-06_5] resources
* Added a new `shared_link_permission_options` field to the [`file--full`][2021-05-06_4] resource
* Added a [shared link section for web links][2021-05-06_6] in the reference documentation
* Added a [permissions page][2021-05-06_7] to the shared links guide documentation
* Combined the [update and add shared link][2021-05-06_8] guide page since they utilize the same PUT endpoint
* Updated code snippets across several shared link pages

## Enhancement Details
* Instead of having to collaborate a user into a file to give edit access, you can set the `shared_link.permissions.can_edit` field to `true`.
* The `can_edit` field will be returned for all shared link objects on files, folders, and web links; however, you can only set it to true for a file.
* Our SDK libraries will gain this feature in the coming quarters.
* If an admin has turned off editable shared links in the admin console, you will not be able to use this feature.

### cURL Example
```curl
curl -i -X PUT 'https://api.box.com/2.0/files/123456789?fields=shared_link' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -H 'Authorization: Bearer [ACCESS TOKEN]' \
        -d '{
          "shared_link": {
            "permissions": {
              "can_preview": true,
              "can_download": true,
              "can_edit": true
            }
          }
        }'
```
