## Client Credentials support in the SDKs

  Our [`.NET`][2022-02-10_3] and [`Java`][2022-02-10_5] SDKs now support Client Credentials Grant
authentication. We plan to release the support for the other SDKs in the
coming weeks.

{/* more */}

Back in November 2020, we released a new authentication type for custom
applications called Client Credentials. Today, we have started releasing SDK
support for the new type.

## Updates

* Added new sample tags and examples on our [Client Credentials guide page][2022-02-10_4].

## Where to get support

Should you have any issues or need further guidance, please post a request to
our [developer forum][2022-02-10_1] for any help needed.
