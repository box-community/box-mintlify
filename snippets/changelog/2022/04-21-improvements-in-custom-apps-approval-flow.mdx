## Improvements In Platform Apps Approval Flow

  Today we added further improvements to the platform apps approval flow. As a result, you can now use a new **Enablement** tab in Developer Console to directly request a Box Admin to enable OAuth 2.0 platform apps. 

Additionally, Box Admins can use Platform Apps Manager to view and enable platform apps in Admin Console.

## Updates

* **Enablement** tab was added for OAuth 2.0 platform apps.
* Information on enabling OAuth 2.0 platform applications has been added to the [platform app approval][2022-04-21_2] guide page.
* Screenshots have been updated on the [platform app approval][2022-04-21_2] and [setup with OAuth 2.0][2022-04-21_3] guide pages.
