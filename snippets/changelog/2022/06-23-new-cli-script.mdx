## Automate tasks with Box CLI and scripts library

  The [Box CLI][2021-06-24_3] now features a sample scripts library with templates you can use to automate your tasks.
For starters, we wanted to provide you with a PowerShell script that allows you to:
* set up a folder structure,
* create managed users,
* add the users to the folder structure as collaborators.

{/* more */}

## Updates

* The Box CLI [quick start guide][2021-06-24_4] now provides instructions on using a PowerShell script to create a folder structure and collaborators.
* The [scripts library][2021-06-24_5] is where you can find all sample scripts. Currently, it includes the PowerShell script but more samples are on the way!
