## Retention policy API improvements

  Recent changes to the API for retention policies and retention policy assignments allow you to remove retention policy assignments and specify the retention length and type for your policies.

{/* more */}

## Updates

* Use the new [`DELETE`][2022-07-23_1] endpoint to remove an existing retention policy assignment:

```bash
curl -i -X DELETE -L https://api.box.net/2.0/retention_policy_assignments/123456/
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' 
```

* Specify the following parameters when [creating][2022-07-23_2] or [updating][2022-07-23_3] retention policies:

    * `retention_length`: Specifies the duration in days that the retention policy will be active for after being assigned to content.
    * `retention_type`: Specifies if the policy is `modifiable` or `non-modifiable`. This means you can either modify the retention policy in full or in a limited way depending on the need to comply with specific regulatory requirements.
