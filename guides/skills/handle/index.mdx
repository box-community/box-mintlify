Within the application or site that is set up as your
[invocation URL](/guides/skills/invocation-url) you will generally need to
perform two tasks.

* [Handle the Skill payload](/guides/skills/handle/payload) - Every time a Box Skills detects a new file is uploaded, copied, or moved to a folder it sends a JSON notification to the invocation URL. This URL needs to be parsed.
* [Apply a Skill Card to a file](/guides/skills/handle/metadata) - The metadata returned from the processing service will need to be stored back as metadata on the file that triggered the event.
