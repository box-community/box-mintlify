Sometimes an application wants to embed a file into a page as a HTML element. An
example would be when working with an audio player.

```html
<audio controls>
  <source src="..." type="audio/mp3">
</audio>
```

In this case, using the regular [download URL][durl] does not work because the
`dl.boxcloud.com` domain does not support [Cross Origin Resource Sharing][cors].

Instead an application can use the following format.

```sh
https://api.box.com/2.0/files/[FILE_ID]/content?access_token=[ACCESS_TOKEN]
```

<Warning>
  **CORS**

  For this to work the application needs to have the domain of the web site
  hosting this file added to the list of allowed domains in the [CORS
  settings][cors].
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Downscope Token**

  Using this method would expose the Access Token to the end user, allowing them
  to potentially use this token to do more than intended. For this reason we
  recommend [downscoping][downscoping] this token accordingly.
</Warning>
