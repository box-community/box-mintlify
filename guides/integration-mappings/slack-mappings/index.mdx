When [Box as the Content Layer][1] is enabled, Box folder is created for
each channel, and all files uploaded to this channel are stored in this folder.
The [Integration Mappings API][2] allows the Box Enterprise Admin (EA) to
customize the upload folder of the Slack channel to any folder within
the enterprise instead of relying on the default one.
